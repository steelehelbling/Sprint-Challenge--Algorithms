#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) linear time just runs a while loop n. sence n is given value it just runs based on n


b)O(n^2) this runs twice it has a loop run in a nother while loop 


c)O(n) its calling a recursive function until it reaches zero depends on n

## Exercise II

do a binary search start a middle if it breaks pick new middle from bottom half of array if the egg dosn't break pick new middle in top part of array keep spliting this till you reach the number of floors till it breaks answer
